## Topic 1

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE,exercise.cap='代码练习区'}

```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## 测试环节

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the filter to select February rather than January
nycflights <- filter(nycflights, month == 1)
```

```{r filter-solution}
nycflights <- filter(nycflights, month == 2)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

下面我们来测试R语言与ERP相关的基础知识:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("下面哪一项不是R语言的最基本数据类型?",
    answer("字符character"),
    answer("数值numeric"),
    answer("日期Date", correct = TRUE),
    answer("整数integer")
  ),
  questionList("下面关于存货核算，错误的描述是",list(
    answer("可以先生成凭证，再进行入库核算", correct = TRUE),
    answer("先入库核算，再出库核算"),
    answer("出库成本核算后先检查合法性报告"),
    answer("次月入库，当月出库也可以进行成本成本核算", correct = TRUE))
  )
)
